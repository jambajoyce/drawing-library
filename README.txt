~~~~~~ My doodles ~~~~~ 
I made three doodles:

1) mondrian
2) parabola
3) cool looking

Their respective html and js files are in my submission folder.

1)
This doodle is my interpretation/replication of a Mondrian painting. 
The picture can be viewed by opening up mondrian.html.
The picture that I attempted to replicate is saved in the folder as Mondrian.jpg.

2) 
This doodle is a circle made from four parabolas with "Math rules!" written in the middle.

3)
I iterated from the parabolas that I created in 2) and made this abstract cool-looking piece.

I had a lot of fun with these doodles!
